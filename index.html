        <h2 class="text">HISTORY</h2>
        <p class="text">The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people,
             it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then
              founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser,
               Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.

            During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for
             dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development
              scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes
               to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brenda
               n Eich to embed the Scheme language.
            
            Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax
             similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.Although the new language and 
             its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995,
              the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.
            
            The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java.
             At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language,
              so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape</p>
        


        <h2 class="text">RISE OF JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <p class="text">
            In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for
             a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release
              of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

            The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998
             and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[20]

            Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market.
            By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer market share reached 95%.[24] This meant that JScript
             became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.

            Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its
             JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.
